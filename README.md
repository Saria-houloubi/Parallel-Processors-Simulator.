# Task-Scheduling-Simulator
For my 4th year in university :books: I wanted to build something for my own.

I worked under the supervision of Dr. Eng. Samer Suliman, We worked on a simulator for different algorithms on how a processor executes assembly instructions such as Scoreboarding and Tomsula. The simulator also shows how loops are being executed and unrolled and how the cache memory works.

**More features are being added to the simulator.

# Project layout
There are two solutions here, and old **legacy** and the one that is being used in production **(currently in Tishreen University, Syria)**.

## :one:.:zero:
The first one was a bit messy and cluttered with a lot of thing experimented in :clipboard: :grin:, you can find it in [here](https://github.com/Saria-houloubi/Task-Scheduling-Simulator/tree/master/Project/ParallelPro).

## :two:.:zero: 
After I stoped working on this project. I have been contacted by some friends wanting to help in new featurs!.

but due to the hole code mess they couldn't :dizzy_face:.

So I had to redo the hole porject and actualy build it in a good clean code which can be maintained much better, in which lead to developing V2.0 which you can find it [here](https://github.com/Saria-houloubi/Task-Scheduling-Simulator/tree/master/Project%20V2.0/ParallelProcessersSimulator).

# Tutorials
A friend of mine wanted to help in his own way by recording some tutorial videos :video:. Which I uploaded them to my [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/c/TestTeam).

The videos go through the old version but it has the same concept:
  1. [Tomasulo Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaOw6v9MziM&list=PLfqLqfbPhVTOsQFGtRS8XmVZOLb4c6za3)
  2. [Loop Unrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WofFhYZYLaE&list=PLfqLqfbPhVTOsQFGtRS8XmVZOLb4c6za3&index=3)
  3. We do support both **Scoreboarding** and **Cache Memory** but those were added in the new version.
  
# Download
If you have arrvied here then thank you for your time reading about the project :sunflower:.

you can get the program from [here](https://sariahouloubi.com/download/TaskSchedulingSimulator):computer:.

# Note
For the time now I am only fixing any bugs that show in it and not activily developing in it.
